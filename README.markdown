This is a (possibly temporary) workspace for an implementation of a browser-based
unit/functional/application test framework for PHP applications. Sins incorporates
a fork of the SimpleTest unit testing framework for PHP: if you want the real thing,
go to http://www.simpletest.org/.

**Version 2.0.0-dev**
